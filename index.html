                <p>Currently completing a MicroDegree in Software engineering at HyperionDev, a renowed tech 
                    educational institute. Where I also managed to maintain an above 90% average throughout the
                    course.
                    During the course we were set well on our way to mastering Python and Java.
                    We also learnt how to apply important computer science, data science and 
                    software engineering principles. An outline of some of the content and technical 
                    skills acquired during the course. Introduction to Python and Java through to advanced 
                    concepts and fundamentals. Completed numerous tasks and capstone projects in Python and Java. 
                    Advanced OOP, Git basics, software testing, system requirements and design, system architecture, 
                    JDBC, Big O notation, machine learning and algorithms, CSS and HTML.

                <p>Wow! Okay now this one was challenging. We had just transitioned from beginner to 
                   intermediate status in our Python programming journey, when a scary looking lannguage
                   called Java was introduced. After acquainting ourselves with all that Java is. We were well and ready
                   to get stuck into this project that tested absolutely everything we had learnt throughout the
                   course along with new concepts such as working with relational database & Structured Query Languages.
                   <br>
                   <br>
                   This project management system was developed for a structural engineering firm
                   called Poised Engineering. The firm would be able to make use of this program to keep track of
                   all the projects on which they work. I built this program with Java and used MySQL to communicate with 
                   the database.

                <p>This Project was given after we'd just learnt how to work with External Data Sources. In this project
                   I displayed my understanig of the concept. Storing, reading and writing data to & from external data 
                   sources such as .txt files and so forth.

                   This program would be good for small businesses, the program can help the business manage tasks assigned 
                   to each member of the team. This system was built with Python. Check code and get more info on how the system 
                   works.

                   This program allows the user to calculate their interest rate on an investment or calculate
                   the amount that should be repaid on a home loan each month. This program was built with Python.

                <p>Looking at any game and thinking to myself, how can I do that? What statements or loops will I need? 
                   What data types and structures would I use? Programming games is a great way to learn how to code and with
                   this project I did just that. I took it as an opportunity to sharpen my understanding of data types, data
                   structures, the usefulness of conditional statements & loops.

                   I was tasked with this project during the software engineer bootcamp at HyperionDev.
                   This is a simple game built with a set of Python game development modules called Pygame. 
                   The game contains one character obeject that will represent the player, three enemy objects 
                   that will represent the enemies & one prize object representing the prize. Have a look at the
                   code to get more info on how the game works.

                    coding up this website your're currently browsing through. I just had a really good time 
                    building this site. The best part for me was just getting started with the build and Learning
